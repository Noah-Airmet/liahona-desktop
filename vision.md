My vision:

My buddy and I who are both LDS want to make a better version of the church's Gospel Library app that has support for additional bible translations, editions of the book of mormon/extended LDS canon, commentaries, maybe even original language texts-- basically an LDS-focused Logos Bible Software. In my moonshot dreams, I'd love to import and format a TON of resources like FAIR articles, Interpreter and BYU RSC articles, tons of general conference stuff, etc. (we would definitely just make this for personal free use between us so we shouldn't have any copyright/legal issues).

We'd like to keep it simple and hopefully keep it all in markdown, which hopefully reduces some complexity in our data import pipeline.
