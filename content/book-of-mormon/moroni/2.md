<sup>1</sup> The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them—

<sup>2</sup> And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this ye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.

<sup>3</sup> Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his first appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.
