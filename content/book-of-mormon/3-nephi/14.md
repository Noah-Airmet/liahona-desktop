<sup>1</sup> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.

<sup>2</sup> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

<sup>3</sup> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

<sup>4</sup> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

<sup>5</sup> Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.

<sup>6</sup> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

<sup>7</sup> Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

<sup>8</sup> For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.

<sup>9</sup> Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone?

<sup>10</sup> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

<sup>11</sup> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?

<sup>12</sup> Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.

<sup>13</sup> Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat;

<sup>14</sup> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

<sup>15</sup> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

<sup>16</sup> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

<sup>17</sup> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

<sup>18</sup> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

<sup>19</sup> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

<sup>20</sup> Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.

<sup>21</sup> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.

<sup>22</sup> Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?

<sup>23</sup> And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

<sup>24</sup> Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock—

<sup>25</sup> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.

<sup>26</sup> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand—

<sup>27</sup> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.
