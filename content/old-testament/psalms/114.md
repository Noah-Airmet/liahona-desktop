<sup>1</sup> When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

<sup>2</sup> Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

<sup>3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

<sup>4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.

<sup>5</sup> What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?

<sup>6</sup> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?

<sup>7</sup> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;

<sup>8</sup> Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
