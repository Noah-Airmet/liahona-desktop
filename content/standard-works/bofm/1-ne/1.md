# 1 Nephi 1

## Verse 1
I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

## Verse 2
Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.

## Verse 3
And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
