<sup>1</sup> And the Lord said unto me: John, my beloved, what desirest thou? For if you shall ask what you will, it shall be granted unto you.

<sup>2</sup> And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me power over death, that I may live and bring souls unto thee.

<sup>3</sup> And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I say unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt tarry until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy before nations, kindreds, tongues and people.

<sup>4</sup> And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? For he desired of me that he might bring souls unto me, but thou desiredst that thou mightest speedily come unto me in my kingdom.

<sup>5</sup> I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do more, or a greater work yet among men than what he has before done.

<sup>6</sup> Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I will make him as flaming fire and a ministering angel; he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation who dwell on the earth.

<sup>7</sup> And I will make thee to minister for him and for thy brother James; and unto you three I will give this power and the keys of this ministry until I come.

<sup>8</sup> Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have according to your desires, for ye both joy in that which ye have desired.
