<sup>1</sup> Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.

<sup>2</sup> Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

<sup>3</sup> And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.

<sup>4</sup> Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things. Even so. Amen.
