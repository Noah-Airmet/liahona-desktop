<sup>1</sup> Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice.

<sup>2</sup> And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith.

<sup>3</sup> Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.

<sup>4</sup> Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and know to be true.

<sup>5</sup> Behold, this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
