<sup>1</sup> Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was crucified for the sins of the world—

<sup>2</sup> Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.

<sup>3</sup> And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite.

<sup>4</sup> And as the covenant which they made unto me has been broken, even so it has become void and of none effect.

<sup>5</sup> And wo to him by whom this offense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea.

<sup>6</sup> But blessed are they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy.

<sup>7</sup> Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.

<sup>8</sup> And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.

<sup>9</sup> And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.

<sup>10</sup> And again, be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early shall find rest to their souls. Even so. Amen.
