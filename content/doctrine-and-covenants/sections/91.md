<sup>1</sup> Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha—There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;

<sup>2</sup> There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men.

<sup>3</sup> Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated.

<sup>4</sup> Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;

<sup>5</sup> And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;

<sup>6</sup> And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
