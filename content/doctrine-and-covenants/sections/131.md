<sup>2</sup> And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];

<sup>3</sup> And if he does not, he cannot obtain it.

<sup>4</sup> He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.

<sup>5</sup> (May 17th, 1843.) The more sure word of prophecy means a man's knowing that he is sealed up unto eternal life, by revelation and the spirit of prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood.

<sup>6</sup> It is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance.

<sup>7</sup> There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes;

<sup>8</sup> We cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter.
