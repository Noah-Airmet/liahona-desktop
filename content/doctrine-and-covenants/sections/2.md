<sup>1</sup> Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.

<sup>2</sup> And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.

<sup>3</sup> If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.
